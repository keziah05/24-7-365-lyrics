It's been three years and six whole months  
Since I saw your face that night  
It took five seconds to fall in love  
And two more to make you mine

Now it's four in the morning, sun's set and  
Seven minutes with you and it's heaven  
Ain't an hour that rolls by  
I love you 24/7, 3-6-5

Give you my name, if you wanted to  
Key to my heart, if you want it too  
And I hope and pray that you'll stay right here  
'Til we're old and gray in our last few years

I'm on a knee, I just need a "yes"  
A couple kids and a picket fence  
Share the memories like an open book  
Every page I read it still got me hooked

And I'm fine spending my whole life on everything you like  
Is it obvious that all of this is right?  
'Cause it's been three years and six whole months  
Since I saw your face that night  
It took five seconds to fall in love  
And two more to make you mine

Now it's four in the morning, sun's set and  
Seven minutes with you and it's heaven  
Ain't an hour that rolls by  
I love yo
