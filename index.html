        It's been three years and six whole months  
        Since I saw your face that night  
        It took five seconds to fall in love  
        And two more to make you mine

        Now it's four in the morning, sun's set and  
        Seven minutes with you and it's heaven  
        Ain't an hour that rolls by  
        I love you 24/7, 3-6-5

        Give you my name, if you wanted to  
        Key to my heart, if you want it too  
        And I hope and pray that you'll stay right here  
        'Til we're old and gray in our last few years

        I'm on a knee, I just need a "yes"  
        A couple kids and a picket fence  
        Share the memories like an open book  
        Every page I read it still got me hooked

        And I'm fine spending my whole life on everything you like  
        Is it obvious that all of this is right?  
        'Cause it's been three years and six whole months  
        Since I saw your face that night  
        It took five seconds to fall in love  
        And two more to make you mine

        Now it's four in the morning, sun's set and  
        Seven minutes with you and it's heaven  
        Ain't an hour that rolls by  
        I love you 24/7, 3-6-5

        I'll share the last bite of every meal  
        I'll wipe your tears when you're in your feels  
        And I'll hold you close through a thunderstorm  
        When it's cold at night, know I'll keep you warm

        'Cause I'm fine spending my whole life on everything you like  
        Is it obvious that all of this is right?

        'Cause it's been three years and six whole months  
        Since I saw your face that night  
        It took five seconds to fall in love  
        And two more to make you mine

        Now it's four in the morning, sun's set and  
        Seven minutes with you and it's heaven  
        Ain't an hour that rolls by  
        I love you 24/7, 3-6-5

        I love you 24/7, 3-6-5

        Now it's four in the morning, sun's set and  
        Seven minutes with you and it's heaven  
        Ain't an hour that rolls by  
        I love you 24/7, 3-6-5
